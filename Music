Writing Music in Mathematica
Introduction:
There is a lot of mathematics behind the core structure of anything and everything related to music.  This Mathematica notebook will give the reader a better understanding of music and how to compose it using Built-in Mathematica Functions

Body:
There are several ways to produce sound using Mathematica.  The first method I will use to produce sound involves manipulating the sine wave using the built in Play function.


Plot[Sin[x], {x, - 2 Pi, 2  Pi}]


The sine curve is the visual representation of a sound wave.  Changing the length of the period of the sine graph will change the sound it will produce.  The longer the period is, the lower the sounding note will be.


Play[Sin[440*2 Pi*t], {t, 0, 1}]
Play[Sin[220*2 Pi*t], {t, 0, 1}]

    5}, {16, 3, 5, 4, 2, 3}, {40, 1, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 5}, {13, 5, 0, 5}, {16, 5,
     6, 5}, {1}},

There is also a direct correlation between these two frequencies; since on curve is exactly half of the other, they are in fact the same note, but one is being played an octave lower.  
Knowing this, we can create every single note.  But, even though we can produce each different note in any octave we want, we cannot play them simultaneously.  So if we wanted to write music using this method, there would be no room for any harmony.  

This is a cool method to observe how sounds are actually produced, but it is very ineffective if you want to write music this way.

There are built-in functions called SoundNote and Sound.  SoundNote can have a bunch of different parameters. It can have one parameter where it just produces a note, two parameters where plays a note for a specified duration, three parameters where it plays a note for a length of time by a specified instrument, or four parameters where it does all of the above but you can specify rendering options for that note.  For this project, we will focus on the first three options.

Sound produces a pop-up that what let you hear what the input list of sounds would actually sound.  You cannot use SoundNote alone, as the program will not produce any sound without the built-in Sound function.  Sound can have two different parameters.  The first one is just one parameter where it produces audio from sound functions, and the second does the same thing as the first, but you can specify the duration of the audio. 

The following are examples of the first three options for SoundNote

Sound[SoundNote[0]]
Sound[SoundNote["C", 1]]
Sound[SoundNote["C4", 1, "Piano"]]

Sound[
SoundNote[0]]

Sound[
SoundNote["C", 1]]

Sound[
SoundNote["C4", 1, "Piano"]]

Note: For simplicity reasons, let the "1" in the timing represent a quarter-note, or one beat for short.  

As you can see, notes can be represented multiple ways.  Notes can be written as an integer between -48 and 60, where each number represents a unique pitch.  You can also specify the note you want using a string containing the desired note.  For example, 0 is the same as "C4", -1 is "B3", -2 is "Bb3", etc. all the way down to "C0".  The number after each note represents the octave in which the note will be played, 0 meaning its the lowest that note can possibly be, 1 meaning an octave above that, all the way to C9.  Also important to note, if you do not include the number after the note letter in a string, ex. "C", Mathematica will assume the missing number is 4.  This is true for every note input without a number following it.

The following is a full list of notes and their equivalences.

If we were writing a song that only used quarter-notes and was played on the piano, the first SoundNote example would suffice.  However, most music isn't like that, so this version of SoundNote would note be efficient/useful in most cases.  The second version, we can now vary the lengths of notes, but we still won't be able to have different instruments play.  So the best method for writing music in Mathematica, using the built-in Sound and SoundNote functions, would be the third way.  

Even though it is the most efficient way, this has not been optimized completely yet; we still cannot produce two sound at once.  There are two ways to solve it, both methods involve using sets.

If we want to write something that has one instrument sound two or more different notes at the same time, in the same rhythm, we can create a set in the first SoundNote parameter.


Sound[SoundNote[{0, 4}, 1, "Piano"]]
Sound[SoundNote[{0, 4, 7, 12}, 1, "Piano"]]

Sound[
SoundNote[{0, 4}, 1, "Piano"]]

Sound[
SoundNote[{0, 4, 7, 12}, 1, "Piano"]]

Now if we want to have two different instruments sound at the same time, or the same instrument playing two different rhythms, we have to make the timing portion of the SoundNote parameter a set as well.


Sound[{SoundNote[{0, 12}, {0, 2}, "Piano"], 
  SoundNote[{5, 9}, {0, 1}, "Piano"], SoundNote[{4, 7}, {1, 2}, "Piano"]}]
Sound[{SoundNote[0, {0, 1}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote[4, {0, 1}, "Flute"]}]

Sound[{
SoundNote[{0, 12}, {0, 2}, "Piano"], 
SoundNote[{5, 9}, {0, 1}, "Piano"], 
SoundNote[{4, 7}, {1, 2}, "Piano"]}]

Sound[{
SoundNote[0, {0, 1}, "Trumpet"], 
SoundNote[4, {0, 1}, "Flute"]}]


All the examples so far have been pitched instruments.  We can also use Sound and SoundNote to imitate the sounds of non-pitched instruments.  Since they are non-pitched, they do not have a specified not to play, so non-pitched instruments will have different parameters in SoundNote.  It requires two parameters, the first one is the instrument name in a string, and the timing of the desired rhythm.


Sound[SoundNote["Snare", {0, 1}]]
Sound[{SoundNote["Snare", {0, .5}], SoundNote["Snare", {.5, 1}]}]

Sound[
SoundNote["Snare", {0, 1}]]

Sound[{
SoundNote["Snare", {0, 0.5}], 
SoundNote["Snare", {0.5, 1}]}]



Now we can write some music in Mathematica in an efficient and useful way.  Here are some fun, short examples.


Sound[{SoundNote["E", {0, 1}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {1, 2}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["C", {2, 3}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {3, 4}, "Trumpet"],

There is one potential problem with writing music in Mathematica, if there is one small mistake in a large amount of code, it will not compile properly and will not produce any sound.  When it does this, there is no easy way of finding the mistake in the code, so you would need to read every single line to find the mistake.  Look at the following example.


Sound[{SoundNote["E", {0, 1}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {1, 2}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["C", {2, 3}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {3, 4}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["E", {4, 5}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["E", {5, 6}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["E", {6, 8}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D" , {8, 9}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["D", {9, 10}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D ", {10, 12}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["E", {12, 13}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["G", {13, 14}, "Trumpet"],

  SoundNote[{"C", "E", "G", "C5"}, {30, 32}, "Trumpet"]}, 8]

In order to check for correctness, you would have to sift through all the lines to make sure that, the first entry is a valid note, the second entry is, in this case, a list of two integers, and make sure the last part is a valid instrument.  Even then, it might not be obvious why it isn't compiling, just like this case.  There is a space in the highlighted Note string, therefore he whole thing won't compile.


Sound[{SoundNote["E", {0, 1}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {1, 2}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["C", {2, 3}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {3, 4}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["E", {4, 5}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["E", {5, 6}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["E", {6, 8}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D" , {8, 9}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["D", {9, 10}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D ", {10, 12}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["E", {12, 13}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["G", {13, 14}, "Trumpet"],

  SoundNote["E", {26, 27}, "Trumpet"], SoundNote["D", {27, 28}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote["C", {28, 30}, "Trumpet"], 
  SoundNote[{"C", "E", "G", "C5"}, {30, 32}, "Trumpet"]},

Now knowing this, here's my attempt at creating a way to check your music code for any mistakes.  Each program will interpret SoundNote functions with 3 parameters as Pitched instruments and SoundNote functions with 2 parameters Non-pitched Instruments.



The following are lists, the first list contains valid strings of notes and their corresponding numbers, the second list contains valid strings of instruments and their corresponding numbers, and lastly the third list contains all the valid percussion instruments.

There are comments in the list to indicate that the following notes are in a specific octave.

Notes = {(*0*){"C0", -48}, {"C#0", -47}, {"Db0", -47}, {"D0", -46}, {"D#0", \

The first part of my solution involves a conversion program.  Since the first entry of each SoundNote function can be written as a string or a number, I will have this program convert all the strings to numbers to make the list easier to work with.  

It is also very important to point out that t only the pitched instruments will need to be converted.  Non-pitched instruments, like the snare drum or triangle, do not have a designated pitch so they do not need to be converted.

I will only have a list of SoundNote functions be inputted into any given list.  At the end of the penultimate module, it will create the music by putting the lists into the built-in Sound function.

Now that we have created a module that converts all the Music note strings to integers, we must do the same with the instruments.  All pitched instruments have an assigned integer value, so we can do a very similar method the ConvertMusicNotes uses.

However, since Non-pitched instruments do not have corresponding integer values built-in, this program will simply check to make sure the string, in each SoundNote file, is a valid instrument according to the Percussion list above.

After it has checked to make sure there are no errors in the code, it will produce music by inputting the lists into the built-in Sound function.  There is also an added parameter, besides the instrument sets, and it is a positive integer.  This allows the person to enter in a speed, or tempo, that they want their piece to be played at.

Now that we've created a way to identify any flaws when writing music in Mathematica, we can safely write densely scored pieces/ very long songs without having to check every single character looking for a mistake.

Results:
Below is an arrangement of "The Imperial March" from Star Wars that I've coded using Mathematica.  I've run it through the "Music" module, so there are no errors.  Here's the final product!

Conclusion:
There are a bunch of different ways to code music using Mathematica.  There is still a lot more to learn about the SoundNote function, the fourth parameter deals with audio processing, which deals with a completely new way to code music.  There are a lot of different options when it comes to audio processing so that you'll be able to code a piece of music and have it sound exactly the way you want it.  H

The portion I coded is basically an introduction to coding music in Mathematica and the modules I made only check one specific way of coding music.  If i wanted to be able to check all the types I've listed in this notebook, I would be able to code it using similar modules.  However, just like the four-parameter SoundNote function, there are more intricate ways to write music in Mathematica such that there would need to be different algorithms to check the correctness of said code.  

I had a really fun time with this project, as it allowed me to combine both of my majors in a unique and somewhat abstract way.  I would love to focus more on this type of project in the future if I am given the opportunity to do so.
